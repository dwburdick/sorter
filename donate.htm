			<p class="lead">You know that friend you can send every nerdy thought, but also every heavy thought?</p>
			<p>If you like this app and have a few spare dollars, I hope you'll donate to <a href="https://donate.lls.org/lls/donate">the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a> in memory of my friend Reid Levin. He's the one with the beard in this gif. I'm the other one.</p>
			<p><img src="reid-and-dave.gif" align="left" alt="A gif of Reid and Dave taken from comedy videos, including an animation by Jason Shwartz">He didn't introduce me to Star Wars, but I spent more time than is reasonable nerding out over it with him and every minute of it was awesome. In addition to that, he was a wise, generous and funny friend. He died <a href="http://www.reidlevin.net/bmt-102-i-didnt-get-to-finish-my-story/">earlier this year</a> after fighting leukemia for seven and a half years.</p>
			<p>We lived near each other in middle and high school, lived together after college (when we made some comedy videos for beer money) until he was diagnosed, and then we hung out again when I moved back to Colorado.</p>
			<p>He was the best and I miss him.</p>
