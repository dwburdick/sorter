			<h3>About Star Wars Ranker</h3>
			<p class="lead">Even just looking at the first three films -- Episodes IV through VI -- the Star Wars universe is incredibly rich. </p>
			<p>The lived-in planets and ships, the seemingly endless diversity of alien life, the constant inner struggle between light and dark -- it's magical.</p>
			<p>But everybody has a different take on it, and that's part of what makes it wonderful. Is your favorite movie "The Empire Strikes Back"? Or is the magic of the very first film unsurpassable?</p>
			<p>Is Episode I the worst in the series? Or is the love-story dialogue of Episode II even worse than a film with multiple Gungans?</p>
			<p>This little app is made to spark, continue and aid such debates. Use it to share your favorites, ranked. Or share the order in which you think the movies should be watched.</p>
			<p><a href="http://nicetryinternet.com/star-wars-ranker/index.htm?WzQsNSw2LDEsMiwzXQ==">Chronological by release date</a>? <a href="http://nicetryinternet.com/star-wars-ranker/index.htm?WzQsNSwyLDMsNl0=">Machete order</a>? <a href="http://nicetryinternet.com/star-wars-ranker/index.htm?WzIsNSw3LDQsMSw2LDNd">Alphabetical for some reason</a>?</p>
			<p>Of course, in my opinion, Star Wars Ranker is best when you add in other Star Wars properties -- books, comics and TV shows. How many of the six seasons of "The Clone Wars" are better than Episode I? Is the Thrawn trilogy of books better than all three prequel films, or only the first two?</p>
			<p>I hope you enjoy using the app, and if you've got any questions, or just need to share your list, you can find me at <a href="http://twitter.com/nicetryinternet">@nicetryinternet</a>.</p>

			<p class="lead" id="money">Are you making any money from this?</p>
			<p>No, I am actually losing money on it (by paying hosting costs) -- and I'm passing the savings on to you! But there is a way that money can change hands: I am asking anybody who likes this little app and has a spare dollar or two to please <a href="https://donate.lls.org/lls/donate">donate to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a> in memory of my dear friend Reid Levin, with whom I thoroughly enjoyed the Star Wars universe for many years. He was the coolest, most generous, warm, welcoming guy, and very funny.</p>
			<p class="lead" id="why">Why did you make this?</p>
			<p>I am a big nerd who wanted to rank his favorite Star Wars things, and I wanted to learn <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a>.</p>
			<p class="lead" id="read">Do you read anything else?</p>
			<p>I do. <a href="http://daveburdick.com/reviews.htm">Here are some things published this year that I read and reviewed</a>. Although given the context of this site, I'll go ahead and recommend the best sci-fi book I read this year, which is just a few years old: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Monson-t.html?_r=0">How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</a>, by Charles Yu. </p>
			<p class="lead" id="machete">What is "<a href="http://nicetryinternet.com/star-wars-ranker/index.htm?WzQsNSwyLDMsNl0=">Machete order</a>"?</p>
			<p>A blogger changed the way Star Wars power nerds watch Star Wars <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">with this well-supported thesis</a>: "George Lucas seems to believe that Star Wars is the story of Anakin Skywalker, but it's really not."</p>
			<p>Also worth highlighting from his post: "The real value of Machete Order becomes clear when you watch Return of the Jedi."</p>
			<p class="lead" id="jj">Can you introduce me to JJ Abrams? (Because I have an idea.)</p>
			<p>No, I am very, very not affiliated with Disney, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, etc., etc. I'm just a guy with some DVDs, books, comics and toys. Like you.</p>
			<p class="lead" id="data">Are you tracking me?</p>
			<p>No, the share URLs are not actually unique to you; they're unique to the order you create. The only tracking I'm doing is via Google Analytics so I have some sense of how many people are using this.</p>
			<p class="lead" id="add">Can you add x feature?</p>
			<p>Maybe! Hit me up at <a href="http://twitter.com/nicetryinternet">@nicetryinternet</a>. I'll see what I can do.</p>
			<p class="lead" id="hype">How long must I wait after seeing "The Force Awakens" to get on the hype train for "Rogue One"? </p>
			<p>One of life's great questions. You must answer it for yourself.</p>
